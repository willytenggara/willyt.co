Hello everyone! 🙋🏻 How are you guys doing?! Hope you guys are doing well!

This topic might not be really important for some of people, but I feel like I want to inform my friends and family in Indonesia about this.
For some of you, you might have known me as _Willy Bernardus_ or _WB_ for the last 29 years but from now on, in 2024 I will change my 'stage' name
to **Willy Tenggara** instead. Although I've been using my first and my middle name (but not the last name 👀) for my whole life,
simply because that's the norm in Indonesia (or at least in my case) and also because most of the registration systems in Indonesia
don't really know how to handle name (except bank). When it is a long name they tend to use just the first and the middle name, then just abbreviate the rest of the names.

While _Willy Bernardus_ sounds fine but I found that there are to many mispronounces both from Indonesian and Australian people so I have decided to change just using
my first and last name. The other reason I want to change to first and last name is because I want to follow the norm in Australia.
One of many things I like about Australia is they have the same naming system across the country, or maybe it's western people's naming system in general.
They simply use first and last name, they don't really care about middle name(s), and I like it. Other than simplicity, my last name: **Tenggara** also means **Southeast** in english.
I feel like, this also a personal revelation. The reason I have the last name _Tenggara_ because my home is facing to 'southeast' (literally) according to my mom.
That's why she gave my last name with _Tenggara_, so it's not a family name at all because my mom and my dad themselve don't even have a last name or family name.
Amazingly enough if you look from the world map then draw a straight line; southeast is pointed to Melbourne, Australia. So I guess it's not a coincidence after all.
With that being said, I truly believe one day I will be an Australian citizen, yes you read that right :) Because finally after 30 years of searching I found my home!

So that's a little bit of information regarding the changes of my name. Thanks for reading!
