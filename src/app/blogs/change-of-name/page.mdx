Hello everyone! 🙋🏻 How are you guys doing?! Hope you guys are doing well!

This blog might not be very important, but I feel like I want to inform my friends and family in Indonesia about this.
For some of you, you might have known me as _Willy Bernardus_ or _WB_ but from now on in the year of 2024 I will change to **Willy Tenggara** instead.
Although I've been using my first and my middle name (but not the last name 👀) for my whole life, simply because that's the norm in Indonesia (or at least in my case)
and also because most of the registration systems in Indonesia don't really know how to hande name (except bank).
When it is a long name they tend to use just the first and the middle name, then just abbreviate the rest of the names.

While _Willy Bernardus_ sounds fine but I found that there are to many mispronounces both from Indonesian and Australian people so I have decided to change just using
my first and last name. The other reason I want to change to first and last name is because I want to follow the norm in Australia.
One of many things I like about Australia is they have the same naming system across the country, or maybe western people naming system in general.
They simply use first and last name, they don't really care about middle name(s). Other than simplicity, my last name: **Tenggara** also means **Southeast** in english.
I feel like this also a personal revelation, during my childhood my mom often said that my home is facing to southeast that's why she named my last name as _Tenggara_.
Weird enough that my actual home in Indonesia is facing to southeast, if you look from the world map, southeast is pointed to Melbourne, Australia :)

So that's a little bit of information regarding the changes of my name. Thanks for reading!
